This is a Git repo for RobotC code written in easyC V4 for Cortex. 
The physical robot that the code coresponds to is a bionically inspired
  robotic arm with the intent to pickup tennis balls and throw them.
The menchanical arm uses three servo-articulated joints at the shoulder, elbox and wrist.
The shoulder also rotates about the vertical axis using a gear.
